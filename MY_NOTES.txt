          WARNINGS:
        ?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to
        read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
        ?: (security.W012) SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is not set to True. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.

        ?: (security.W016) You have 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' in your MIDDLEWARE, but you have not set CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE to True. Using a secure-only CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffe
        rs to steal the CSRF token.
        ?: (security.W022) You have not set the SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY setting. Without this, your site will not send a Referrer-Policy header. You should consider enabling this header to protect user privacy.




  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pause and work on testing/feedback (MVP)

  - set s3 as private, AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH = True. Make it work with editor
  - s3 safety
  x environment variables
  - make sure functionality is blocked from server side (ej, check username matches author for edit and post, no edits on posted entries, no entries added on not posted entries, etc.)
  - better image upload functionality
  - invite a friend
  - word counter for title and short description
  - general search
  - in entry preview information based on entry_id location hovered
  - in project list, preview information based on project hovered
  x add menu button on top left, move logo top right and user info top center
  - menu button:
    - home,
        - following projects (started, participating and following, filtered by latest with changes)
        - my entries
    - projects,
        - projects started by me (in automatic followed, can un-follow)
        - projects in which I'm participating (in automatic following, can un-follow)
        - other projects that I'm following (can un-follow)
        - discover new projects
    - entries,
        - my entries
        - entries that I'm following
        - discover new entries
  - my profile,
      - interests
      - contacts
  - entry hashtags or topics
  - add to entry view
  - add comment functionality
    - comments to remain open after publishing in order to allow for clarifications

  - list requirements with links in concept view page
  x creative commons integration
  - search functionality
  - number of views, collaborators, entries and comments.
  - forgot password functionality

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice to have
 - add hovered entry information as a pop-up after hovering for 2 sec to the tree view
 - animated logo
 - help queues
 - entry picture

Future advanced development
 - feedback from deeper entries to shallower entries (the right hand of the V model)
 - smart relationship classification between projects and entries (which entries or projects are similar between each other, through AI classification based on hashtags, content and users)
 - allow users to move content up or down in the project tree,
 - show content in trees based on both personal and public weighted positions ^Ë… at the endo of each entry button in the tree
    - public weighted positions could be based on
        - number of people that decided to move that content ( similar to number of reviews )
        - user rating
        - customer positioning (for customer related projects, or prices)
 - allow users to minimize entries in tree
 - user ratings/status based on topics
 - community where you can find people with similar profiles as yours
 - base on (can edit) and copy (can't edit) entries.

Random Ideas:
  - competitions with prices, sponsored by companies championed by institutions and universities
  - rewards could be given based on position as follows

        order reward distribution
          1	          50%
          2	          30%
          3	          20%

        of which, type of entry distribution
          concept	    33%
          design	    33%
	        validation	33%

        of which, depth distribution
          1st level	  50%
          2nd level	  30%
          3rd level	  20%

    - order based as well on judges (for prices) or customer
    - participants have the option of recommending other users to participate
    - internal money for trading collaboration, I collaborate in exchange of having others collaborate in my projects
